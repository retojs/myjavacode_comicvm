"The archetypal Masculine side of your nature represents the part of you that is logical and orderly, the part that discriminates, differentiates, focuses, and defines. It is capable of providing you with assertion and power. In your symbolic life He will often be a warrior, great teacher, a protector, practical and strong, ruled by the mind. "

"Your archetypal Feminine side is more relational, inclusive, nurturing, more diffused, soft, and receptive. In your dream life She may come through as a beautiful maiden, a mermaid, a seductive nymph or spirit who magically entices the male into the darkness of the unconscious mind. She lures the male onto "the path." She is perfectly comfortable in the diffused, uncanny world of spirit. She is magical and spontaneous, ruled by the heart. He is intellectual and in charge; she is intuitive and inspired. (Keep in mind we are speaking of Principle here, not gender.) "

Personal Thoughts (15.8.2013)

Ariel the little merkat / Ariel das kleine Meerjungschweinchen

soll eine Geschichte über alles sein. Den Sinn des Lebens und des Universums und allem. 
Daher sind die Themen immer polar vorhanden, quasi als widersprüchliche Sichtweisen. wie z.B. Wissenschaft vs. Glaube / Spiritualität (Seestern vs. Meerjungfrau), Globale Erwärmung vs. Persönliches Streben nach Glück, usw.
